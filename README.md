  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  my interests include: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Henry Stickmin, Pokémon, and a loooooot more. <br><br>
  you can find me at the Library in Safe servers, though I occasionally hop on 18+ servers. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as LCB Hubert or another ProjectMoon character. <br><br>
  C + H is okay, but please whisper to interact with me (and/or to ask for other socials like Discord), public chat is too scary.
