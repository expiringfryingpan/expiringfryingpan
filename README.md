  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  you can find me next to the <b>Library</b> or <b>Bakery</b> in Safe servers - I occasionally hop on 18+ servers. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as <i>ProjectMoon</i> characters, (occasionally) <i>Touhou</i> characters, and rarely OCs. <br><br>
  <b>C + H, Booping</b> are okay; I <i>prefer</i> <b>w2i</b>, however I may not always respond. <br>
  I'm usually silent (except around friends, sometimes). crowns, etc. are fine, I don't really mind! <br><br>
  write/draw stuff for me on my strawpage (if you want); links to my other socials are there, too. <br><br>
