hi! I'm **Kana**, you can also call me *Expand*. you're probably here from Pony Town.

my current interests are: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Henry Stickmin & Pokemon.

I'm usually at the Library in Safe servers, but I occasionally hop on 18+ servers (since there's lesser people there); you'll mostly find me as **LCB Hubert** or another _ProjectMoon_ character.

I **HIGHLY** recommend whispering to interact _(and to ask for other socials like Discord)_, public chat is too scary for me.
