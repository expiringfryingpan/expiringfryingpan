  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  you can find me next to the <b>Library</b>, or wherever my friends are at in Safe servers - I'm sometimes in 18+ servers at the <b>Docks</b>. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as <i>ProjectMoon</i> or <i>Project Sekai</i> characters, sometimes OCs. <br><br>
  I'm mostly silent; not a conversation starter, except around friends (sometimes). <br>
  though I don't always respond, 👑s & anything else are fine. I don't mind! <br><br>
