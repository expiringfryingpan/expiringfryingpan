  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  you can find me next to the <b>Library</b>, <b>Bakery</b>, or wherever my friends are at in Safe servers - I occasionally hop on 18+ servers, mainly near <b>Docks</b>. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as <i>ProjectMoon</i> characters, <i>Touhou</i> characters, and rarely other fandom characters or OCs. <br><br>
  I'm mostly silent, except around friends (sometimes). I'm not the type to start conversations. <br>
  though I don't always respond, ðŸ‘‘s & anything else are fine. I don't really mind! <br><br>
  write/draw stuff for me on my strawpage (if you want); links to my other socials are there, too. <br><br>
