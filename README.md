  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  my current interests include: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Roblox, Henry Stickmin & Pokémon. <br><br>
  you can find me next to the Library (or Cafe) in Safe servers - I occasionally hop on 18+ servers. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as LCB Hubert or another ProjectMoon character. <br><br>
  C + H is okay; please w2i (and/or to ask for other socials like Discord), public chat is too scary.
