hi! I'm **Kana**, you can also call me *Expand*. you're probably here from Pony Town.

my interests currently are: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Henry Stickmin & Pokemon.

I'm usually at the Library in Safe servers; you'll mostly find me as **LCB Hubert** or **The Reaved Lamenter**.

I **HIGHLY** recommend whispering to interact _(and to ask for other socials like Discord)_, public chat is simply too scary for me.
