hi! I'm **Kana**, you can also call me *Expand*. you're probably here from Pony Town.

my interests include: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Henry Stickmin, Pokémon, and a loooooot more.

I'm usually at the Library in Safe servers, but I occasionally hop on 18+ servers (since there's lesser people there); you'll mostly find me as **LCB Hubert** or another _ProjectMoon_ character.

C + H is okay; I **HIGHLY** recommend whispering to interact with me _(and/or to ask for other socials like Discord)_, public chat is too scary.
