  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  my current interests include: <br>
  <i>ProjectMoon, Touhou, Roblox, Henry Stickmin & Pokémon.</i> <br><br>
  you can find me next to the <b>Library</b> (or <b>Cafe</b>) in Safe servers - I occasionally hop on 18+ servers. <br><br>
  I'm usually cosplaying as <b>LCB Hubert</b>, <b>Sancho</b>, or another <i>ProjectMoon</i> character. <br><br>
  <b>C + H</b> is okay, but <i>please <b>w2i</b></i>. I'm unlikely to say anything unless you talk to me directly. <br><br>
  write/draw stuff for me on my strawpage (if you want); links to my other socials are there, too. <br><br>
