  hi! I'm Kana. you're probably here from Pony Town. <br><br>
  my interests include: ProjectMoon, Touhou, Henry Stickmin, Pokémon, and a loooooot more. <br><br>
  I'm usually at the Library in Safe servers, but I occasionally hop on 18+ servers. you'll mostly find me as LCB Hubert or another ProjectMoon character. <br><br>
  C + H is okay, but I *HIGHLY* recommend whispering to interact with me (and/or to ask for other socials like Discord), public chat is too scary.
